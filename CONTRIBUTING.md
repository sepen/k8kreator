# Contributing

Pull requests, bug reports, and all other forms of contribution are welcomed and highly encouraged!

### Opening an Issue

Before creating an issue, check if you are using the latest version of the project. If you are not up-to-date, see if updating fixes your issue first.

### Submitting Pull Requests

Before forking the repo and creating a pull request for non-trivial changes, it is usually best to first open an issue to discuss the changes, or discuss your intended approach for solving the problem in the comments for an existing issue.

Pull request guidelines:

* **Smaller is better**. Submit one pull request per bug fix or feature. A pull request should contain isolated changes pertaining to a single bug fix or feature implementation. Do not refactor or reformat code that is unrelated to your change. It is better to submit many small pull requests rather than a single large one. Enormous pull requests will take enormous amounts of time to review, or may be rejected altogether.

* **Coordinate bigger changes**. For large and non-trivial changes, open an issue to discuss a strategy with the maintainers. Otherwise, you risk doing a lot of work for nothing!

* **Prioritize understanding over cleverness**. Write code clearly and concisely. Remember that source code usually gets written once and read often. Ensure the code is clear to the reader. The purpose and logic should be obvious to a reasonably skilled developer, otherwise you should add a comment that explains it.

* **Follow existing coding style and conventions**. Keep your code consistent with the style, formatting, and conventions in the rest of the code base. When possible, these will be enforced with a linter. Consistency makes it easier to review and modify in the future.

* **Use spaces**, not tabs.

* **Update the example project** if one exists to exercise any new functionality you have added.

* **Add documentation**. Document your changes with code doc comments or in existing guides.

* **Use the repo's default branch**. Branch from and submit your pull request to the repo's default branch. Usually this is main, but it could be dev, develop, or master.

* **Resolve any merge conflicts** that occur.
